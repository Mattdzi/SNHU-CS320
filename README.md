# **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
The way I ensured my code was functional and secure was quality testing. I must be non-biased with my code when it comes to testing. The aim is to demonstrate or refute that the code accomplishes what it is meant to accomplish and do nothing not intended. This is also the reason why independent testing is very popular. Include the tests in the continuous integration pipelines so that they execute automatically and prevent the build from failing. Do not just turn the tests off if they fail, instead check and correct the tests.
# **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
The way that I had interpreted the user needs and incorporated them into the program was using the 5 Whys technique. Another useful technique is shoulder surfing, this is observing someone else us another piece of software as you inquire about their preferences. Making mock-ups for the end user can also aid in avoiding bugs and/or errors in the product on release.  
# **How do I approach designing software?**
The way I approach designing software is helping the client understand their vision so they can explain it to others. Elicitation might encourage a client who does not having everything up go further into what they aim to be their goal. I believe that the most critical stage in gathering requirements is elicitation.
